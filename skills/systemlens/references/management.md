# systemlens management

`systemlens` indexes Java/Spring architecture facts locally from source ASTs.
For complex or polyglot repositories, use it as the deterministic baseline and
add unsupported microservice, messaging and database facts through the AI graph
or reviewed MCP enrichment workflow.

## Installation

```bash
uv tool install systemlens
systemlens version
```

Architecture extraction is local and does not require a model download, rule
pack or external code-analysis service.

## Project initialization

```bash
systemlens init
systemlens doctor
systemlens index
```

If `.systemlens/config.yml` already exists, keep it and run `systemlens index`; do not
recreate it silently.

## MCP setup

The MCP server reads the project from its process working directory. Initialize
and index the project first, then start the coding agent from that repository.

```bash
codex mcp add systemlens -- systemlens mcp
codex mcp get systemlens
```

For another MCP-compatible client:

```json
{"mcpServers": {"systemlens": {"command": "systemlens", "args": ["mcp"]}}}
```

## Refreshing the index

- After code changes: run `systemlens index`.
- After a broad refactor or extractor upgrade: run `systemlens index --full`.
- Use `systemlens microservices`, `systemlens topics`, `systemlens apis`, `systemlens mongodb`,
  `systemlens dtos`, `systemlens modules`, `systemlens analyze coverage`,
  `systemlens analyze indexing-issues` and `systemlens analyze audit` for architecture questions.
- Use `systemlens index --topic-strategy strategy1` only for repositories that
  follow the documented Strategy1 Kafka and REST conventions.
- With Strategy1, `src/main/resources/openapi/xxx.rest` publishes valid
  same-named contracts and every valid YAML or JSON contract in
  `model-xxx/src/main/resources/openapi/`. Contract file names in that module
  may differ from `xxx`; run `systemlens index --full --topic-strategy strategy1`
  after changing this declaration or those contracts.
- Every build module inventories all valid YAML or JSON OpenAPI contracts in
  its own `src/main/resources/openapi/` directory, regardless of filename.

## Troubleshooting

- `systemlens` missing: install `systemlens`.
- Missing configuration: run `systemlens init` from the target repository.
- Absent index: run `systemlens index`.
- Unresolved facts: run `systemlens analyze indexing-issues --json` and inspect
  the recorded source evidence; do not replace them with guessed dependencies.
- For a repository-wide inventory, review source, build descriptors,
  application configuration, migrations/schema files, Dockerfiles and
  Kubernetes/Helm/Terraform manifests in addition to indexed AST results.
  Re-run `coverage` after deciding that a file family is outside the configured
  perimeter.
