# systemlens Architecture Explorer

Use `systemlens` to query a local, persisted Java/Spring architecture inventory.
Start with the inventory before inspecting implementation files. It describes
services, modules, HTTP APIs, Kafka topics, MongoDB collections and their
evidenced relationships.

## Documentation language

Write user-facing documentation, generated report text and examples in English.
Preserve exact CLI output, source snippets and user-provided text when quoting
them.

## Ownership

Work from the target repository root. Own the `systemlens` lifecycle for that
project.

- Run `systemlens doctor` before drawing broad architectural conclusions.
- If configuration is missing, run `systemlens init`; never overwrite an existing
  `.systemlens/config.yml`.
- If the index is absent or source/configuration changed, run `systemlens index`
  before querying. Use `systemlens index --full` after a broad refactor or an
  extractor upgrade.
- Treat `systemlens` as static, source-evidenced analysis. Keep dynamic,
  ambiguous and unresolved integrations explicit; do not infer a dependency from
  a coincidental route or a topic name.

## Setup

For a fresh project:

```bash
systemlens init
systemlens doctor
systemlens index
```

The configuration controls the indexed source perimeter. See
[settings.md](references/settings.md) only when the perimeter must change.

## Architecture workflow

Start with the indexed architecture and retrieve source evidence only when needed:

1. `systemlens microservices` — discover services and main integrations.
2. `systemlens microservices show <name>` — inspect one service.
3. `systemlens microservices topics <name>`, `apis <name>` or `mongodb <name>` —
   follow linked objects.
4. `systemlens topics`, `systemlens apis`, `systemlens dtos` or
   `systemlens mongodb` — inspect a shared object from the other direction.
5. `systemlens analyze coverage` and `systemlens analyze indexing-issues` —
   identify inventory limits before relying on a conclusion.
6. `systemlens analyze audit` — assess static topology risks.
7. `systemlens analyze microservices impact <name>` or `path <source> <target>` —
   inspect dependencies and impact paths.

```bash
systemlens microservices show order-service
systemlens topics consumers orders.created
systemlens apis consumers 'POST /payments'
systemlens mongodb services orders
systemlens modules show shared-domain
systemlens analyze coverage
systemlens analyze indexing-issues
systemlens analyze audit
```

Kafka message types are shown only when explicit in the source. A missing type
is unknown, not an invitation to infer it from a topic name or serializer.

Use `--json` when a downstream step needs structured results. For a Kafka topic,
use `systemlens topics trace <topic>`; for a Kafka topic or HTTP route, use the
MCP `trace_message_flow` tool to follow indexed source sites.

For the complete extraction contract, including supported Java/Spring forms,
dynamic-value handling, exact REST target resolution, Kafka matching,
module/OpenAPI attribution, MongoDB evidence and Strategy1 conventions, read
[analysis-rules.md](references/analysis-rules.md). Never enable Strategy1 just
to force an expected edge; verify the repository convention first.

When the repository follows the documented `getTopics()` and
`${kafka.topics.*.name}` conventions, use the explicit strategy:

```bash
systemlens index --topic-strategy strategy1
```

It may derive convention-based Kafka and configured HTTP dependencies. Treat
these as convention-derived facts and inspect their source evidence. Do not
enable this strategy solely to make an expected relation appear.

For the Strategy1 OpenAPI publication convention, a declaration at
`src/main/resources/openapi/xxx.rest` can publish valid same-named contracts
anywhere in the repository. It also publishes every valid YAML or JSON OpenAPI
contract under `model-xxx/src/main/resources/openapi/`; contract file names do
not need to match `xxx`. Reindex with `--full --topic-strategy strategy1` after
adding or moving a declaration or shared contract.

Every build module independently inventories all valid YAML or JSON OpenAPI
documents under its own `src/main/resources/openapi/` directory. Contract file
names do not need to be `openapi.*` or `swagger.*`.

## Runtime APM investigation

When read-only Elasticsearch access is configured and the user needs observed
runtime service dependencies, errors, or latency, export a bounded APM digest:

```bash
systemlens apm doctor --json
systemlens apm export --since 1h --environment production --out apm-digest.json
```

Configure `SYSTEMLENS_ELASTICSEARCH_URL` and
`SYSTEMLENS_ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY` in the shell; do not put credentials in a
command, report, or prompt. The digest contains `service_destination` metric
aggregates only, never raw spans or request data. It is a one-shot observed
dataset: it is not persisted in the SystemLens index, surfaced through MCP, or
evidence for a static source relationship. Check `coverage` before treating an
absent relation as conclusive, because the aggregation and export are bounded.

For a human performance investigation, produce the explicit runtime report
instead of asking an agent to interpret raw APM events:

```bash
systemlens apm report --since 1h --environment production --html apm-runtime.html
```

The report ranks service and transaction tail latency with average and P95 and
provides an interactive directed service map. Circle nodes are observed
services; diamond nodes are observed messaging targets. Arrows go from source
service to target, are labelled HTTP or `send`, and carry volume and aggregate
risk styling. A messaging target is not claimed to be a confirmed broker topic.
Selecting a service reveals its HTTP (`request` or `http`), messaging
(`messaging`), and other transaction aggregates plus inbound and outbound
dependencies. The map does not claim that a transaction called a dependency;
that would require a separately approved sampled-span aggregate. Dependency P95
is intentionally unavailable in this first pass.
The report contains aggregates and a bounded Timeline projection of recorded
transaction fields. It never includes `_source`, trace IDs, request data,
headers, bodies, logs, or error messages. It is observed runtime context, not
evidence of a static source relationship; review its window and coverage before
drawing conclusions.
Its interactive graph reuses the Graphology/Sigma.js CDN assets of the
architecture export and retains an embedded SVG fallback when they are offline.

## Exports and MCP

```bash
systemlens export microservices --html architecture.html
systemlens export microservices --c4 likec4-project
systemlens export modules --html module-dependencies.html
systemlens mcp
```

When deterministic extraction cannot resolve repository-specific conventions,
have the analysis agent produce a `systemlens-ai-graph-v1` manifest and render
it without changing the persisted index:

```bash
systemlens export microservices --graph architecture.ai-graph.json --html architecture.html --root-path /path/to/checkout
```

The manifest must keep source evidence relative, include confidence and
`confirmed`/`proposed`/`ambiguous`/`unresolved` status on every claim, and give
an explicit reason for unresolved claims. SystemLens draws confirmed and
proposed claims and puts ambiguous or unresolved claims in the Quality panel;
it never turns an AI guess into persisted source topology. See
[ai-graph.md](references/ai-graph.md) for the full contract and example.

Exports consume the persisted snapshot; refresh the index deliberately when
source changes must be reflected. Use `--root-path` only to resolve local source
links at HTML export time.

The MCP server exposes the same indexed architecture. Start the agent from the
initialized repository so it can locate `.systemlens/config.yml` and its local
index. Query it before an edit, and call `reindex_architecture` after relevant
changes before making further architecture claims.
